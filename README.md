## JWT and Authorization Functionality
This project implements JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authorization. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The token is signed using a secret key to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the claims. In this project, JWT is used to manage user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authenticated users can access and modify the KanBan board.
